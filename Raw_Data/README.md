Here, the original data sets from FamiLinx are not included due to their high size. 

The original FamiLinx database consists of two datasets:

- profiles-anon.txt : individuals in FamiLinx with all variables
- relations-anon.txt : link between individuals and their parents by means of individual ID variable (profileid)

All these data sets are available at the following [link](https://osf.io/ydzfq/).
